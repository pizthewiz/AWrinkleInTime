GrowOldTogether
===============

[Art Hack Day](http://arthackday.net/gaffta) project with [Jonathan Dahan](https://github.com/jedahan) and [Erik van der Molen](http://www.officevsoffice.com) to bring mortality to digital images and use the viewer's consumption as a forced means of aging.

the sketches use the [v002 Film Effects](http://v002.info/plugins/v002-film-effects-10/), [v002 Movie Player](http://v002.info/plugins-sources/v002-movie-player-beta/) and [Wild Bunch](https://github.com/pizthewiz/WildBunch) plug-ins.
